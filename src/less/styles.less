// The less-loader stubs less' fileLoader and passes all queries to the webpack resolving engine.
// Thus you can import your less-modules from node_modules.
// Just prepend them with a ~ which tells webpack to look-up the node_modules
// Ex. @import "~bootstrap/less/bootstrap";

// It's important to only prepend it with ~, because ~/ resolves to the home-directory.
// webpack needs to distinguish between bootstrap in current folder and ~bootstrap
// because css- and less-files have no special syntax for importing relative files.
// Writing @import "file" is the same as @import "./file";

@import '~bootstrap/less/bootstrap';
@import 'components/app';
@import 'components/pages/home';
@import 'components/pages/results';
